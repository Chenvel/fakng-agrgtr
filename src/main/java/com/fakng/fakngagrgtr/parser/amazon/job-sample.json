  "description": "<br/>Amazon Web Services (AWS) Virtual Private Network (VPN) team is looking for a Senior Software Developer. Come join us in making network level security simple, available, and performant. <br/><br/><br/>Customers use AWS Site-to-Site VPN to establish secure connections to the AWS cloud, enabling seamless integration and inter-operation. We listen closely to what customers tell us they need in networking services and work to deliver, which could be an improvement to an existing feature, a radically new idea, or something in between. <br/><br/><br/>On any given day we use Scala, C++, Python, Java, Ruby as well as various native AWS services and Amazon-internal tools. We don\'t expect you to be an expert in, or know all of, the technologies listed, but we do expect you to be excited to learn about them. As an experienced engineer in this team, you will play a committed role in developing high quality software designs and solutions to our complex problems. <br/><br/><br/>We care about career growth and work-life harmony. We follow a DevOps model and this position involves on-call responsibilities, but we strive to reduce pages and ensure our systems are fault tolerant. We encourage ownership of our software and take time to learn from any challenges. <br/><br/><br/>Inclusive Team Culture<br/> Here at AWS, we embrace our differences. We are committed to furthering our culture of inclusion. We have ten employee-led affinity groups, reaching 40,000 employees in over 190 chapters globally. We have innovative benefit offerings, and host annual and ongoing learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon (gender diversity) conferences. Amazon\\u2019s culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 14 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.<br/> <br/> Work/Life Balance <br/> Our team puts a high value on work-life balance. It isn\\u2019t about how many hours you spend at home or at work; it\\u2019s about the flow you establish that brings energy to both parts of your life. We believe striking the right balance between your personal and professional life is critical to life-long happiness and fulfillment. We offer flexibility in working hours and encourage you to find your own balance between your work and personal lives.<br/> <br/> Mentorship &amp; Career Growth<br/> Our team is dedicated to supporting new members. We have a broad mix of experience levels and tenures, and we\\u2019re building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship. Our senior members enjoy one-on-one mentoring and thorough, but kind, code reviews. We care about your career growth and strive to assign projects based on what will help each team member develop into a better-rounded engineer and enable them to take on more complex tasks in the future<br/><br/>",
